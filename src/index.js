Over time, this brown leather sofaâ€™s full-aniline upholstery will develop a worn-in vintage look. Snuggle up with your cutie (animal or human) and dive into a bowl of popcorn. This sofa is really hard to leave. Natural color variations, wrinkles and creases are part of the unique characteristics of this leather. It will develop a relaxed vintage look with regular use.",
